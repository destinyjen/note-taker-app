# Note-taker-app
My goal was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

# Installation

Open a intergrated terminal and run the command "npm i".

Once the packages install, run the command "npm run start" in the terminal. 

A localhost link will appear (3001).

Press CTRL and click the link to deploy the application.

# Usage

1. After installing and running the application, click "Get Started".

2. Next, you will be redirected to a page with pre-saved notes.

3. When typing the Note Title, and Note Description in the form.

4. A new icon appears in the top left of the application called "Save Note" and "Clear Form".

5. Clicking "Save Note" Will Cause the note to appear on the left sidebar, and clicking "Clear Form" Will erase all data entered in the form.

6. The user can click on any of the side notes on the left tab to see the note title and the note descriptions.
